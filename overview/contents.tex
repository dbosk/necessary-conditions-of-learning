    have learned to see it differently.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Explains other learning theories, \eg Vygotsky~\cite{Vygotsky}.

\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{Conjecture}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item OLI works due to the quiz-question feedback yields \emph{contrast}.
      \item Material usually focus on induction (\emph{generalization} without 
        contrast), so students get the necessary pattern of variation.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{Conjecture}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Students need to repeat things 8 times to learn.
      \item That's how many times they need to discern the critical 
        aspects/features.
      \item With properly designed material\footnote{%
          With the possibility to experience the necessary patterns of 
          variations.
        }, this number can be reduced.
