    \begin{description}
      \item[Subject content] \eg
        quadratic equations.

      \item[Educational objective] (or \emph{intended learning outcome}) \eg
        solve problems requiring quadratic equations.

      \item[Intended object of learning] \eg
        what quadratic equations have non-real roots.

      \item[Enacted object of learning] \eg
        \enquote{hopefully} what quadratic equations have non-real roots,
        but maybe only \emph{that} quadratic equations have non-real roots.

      \item[Lived object of learning] \eg
        \enquote{hopefully} what quadratic equations have non-real roots,
        but maybe only that some quadratic equations can't be solved.
