Hello, I'm Daniel. I'll
tell you about a small project

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,769
of mine that I'm
starting up, Technology Enhanced

3
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:08,039
Learning Studies. The name
is a combination of two

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,139
fields. It's the first
one being Technology Enhanced

5
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,819
Learning, which provides
a synchronous yet interactive

6
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:17,430
learning material which is reusable
and particularly

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,969
reproducible when it comes
to studying it.

8
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:23,069
And this lends itself
nicely to to the second half,

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,350
which is Learning
Studies. And this is a research

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,619
methodology developed by Ference Marton at Gothenburg

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,590
University. It consists
of combining the variation

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,840
theory of learning
with design based research,

13
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,569
which is an iterative
research methodology

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,669
to improve
something like teaching.

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,709
And the idea is
to combine these two

16
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,460
because they provide
nice properties, particularly

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,560
the reproducibility
and scalability.

18
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,580
And the idea is to create
teaching material

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,159
for introductory
programming, which is well

20
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,819
founded in pedagogy and didactic
research. However,

21
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,920
the impact for KTH
is, of course, I'll apply this

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,500
in my introductory
programming courses. I have

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,750
a bit more than 300
students per year and different types

24
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,180
of students, which is good
for studying the effect

25
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,430
of the teaching. It covers three programs.

26
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,160
I also ... all of which are non-CS majors.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,750
I recruit TAs from the CL
program, which is nice

28
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,150
because they are well
versed in other theories

29
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,400
of learning so they are equipped with

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,489
research methodology
for studying learning,

31
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:28,860
but they will also learn
and practice this methodology,

32
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,840
which is not
included in their program.

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,050
And lastly, they also
get teaching material

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,150
which they have
helped develop and research

35
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,209
which is open to use,
because it's open under a Creative

36
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:42,510
Commons license.
However, it also impacts society

37
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,680
because we will open
this teaching for schools,

38
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,069
because this
teaching is available by design

39
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,139
and the schools must
teach programming and the maths

40
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,330
classes starting already
in the first year. However,

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,630
our material is relevant
from seventh grade

42
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,959
and onwards. These CL TAs
will eventually move

43
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,430
to schools where they can
continue to contribute

44
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:02,709
and study this
material and improving it.

45
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:05,739
And the schools, the teachers
who

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,009
haven't taken the CL
program, they can

47
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,099
contribute anyway as
well, which is nice because then

48
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,050
they get into this
research practice, which can benefit

49
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:17,380
improving teaching
in other subjects and other

50
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,500
classes that they teach. And
that was it. Thanks a lot.
