    \begin{itemize}
      \item Variation theory
      \item Phenomenography
      \item Learning studies
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Beautiful foundation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Explains other learning theories, \eg Vygotsky~\cite{Vygotsky} and 
        Montessori.
      \item Takes other papers' results, explain them with the theory.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{alertblock}{Conjecture}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item OLI works due to the quiz-question feedback yields \emph{contrast}.
      \item Material usually focus on induction (\emph{generalization} without 
        contrast).
      \item \Ie students get the necessary pattern of variation.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{alertblock}{Conjecture}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Students need to repeat things 8 times to learn.
      \item That's how many times they need to discern the critical 
        aspects/features.
      \item With properly designed material\footnote{%
          With the possibility to experience the necessary patterns of 
          variations.
        }, this number can be reduced.

  \begin{block}{Ending quote}
    \textcquote[p.~246, my emphasis]{NecessaryConditionsOfLearning}{%
          \enquote{Top scores from Shanghai stun educators,} wrote the 
          \emph{New York Times} on December 7, 2010.
          \textelp{}
          A number of different explanations were presented in the article 
          \textins{by journalists, politicians, education experts}.
          Interestingly, there was not a single word said about the things that 
          this whole book is dealing with: how the different subjects are 
          learned and taught. \emph{Could it not be the case that students are 
            better at solving quadratic equations because they are taught to 
          solve quadratic equations in more powerful ways?}%
